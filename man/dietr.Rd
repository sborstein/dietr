Title: An R package to estimate trophic level from diet and food item data

Version: 1.1.1

Date: 2020-3-3

License: GPL (>= 2)

This package allows users to calculte trophic levels from proportional diet data or from food 
items given trophic levels of the prey items. This package calculates trophic level following 
the procedures from TrophLab, which was a microsoft access program. This implementation is faster
than the original microsoft access program and also allows for a hierarchical estimation of 
trophic level given a corresponding "taxonomy" data frame (i.e. estimate trophic level for a 
individual,population,species, etc.). It also contains other functions for measuring electivity 
indices, compound trophic indices (ex. Feeding Quotient, Index of Preponderance), Vacuity Index,
and Gastro-somatic Index.
